// Function Declaration (Statement)
function greet() {
  return "Hello";
}


// EXPLANATION :-

// This is a function declaration â€” and itâ€™s a statement.
// It starts with the function keyword directly.
// It's hoisted to the top of its scope, meaning you can call greet() even before it's defined in the code.

// // ðŸª„ What is Hoisting in JavaScript?
// Hoisting is JavaScriptâ€™s way of moving declarations to the top of the current scope before code runs.

// In simple words:
// JavaScript reads your code before it runs, and lifts (hoists) all var, function, and 
// some other declarations to the top of their scope (function or global).
