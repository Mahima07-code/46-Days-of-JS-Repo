<!-- Analysis:

DOM Construction:
The browser parses the HTML to create the DOM tree, which includes both <div> elements.

CSSOM Construction:
The browser parses the CSS to create the CSSOM, noting the styles for .hidden and .visible classes.

Render Tree Construction:
The browser combines the DOM and CSSOM to form the Render Tree.
The <div> with class hidden is excluded from the Render Tree because display: none removes it from the visual flow.
The <div> with class visible is included in the Render Tree with its computed styles (blue color and 20px font size). -->

  
  
  
  <!-- Visual Representation
The process can be visualized as follows:

1. DOM Tree:

Includes all elements:

     <html>
       <head>
       <body>
          <div class="visible">
          <div class="hidden">

2.CSSOM Tree:

Contains style rules:

    .hidden { display: none; }
    .visible { color: blue; font-size: 20px; }

3.Render Tree:

Combines visible elements and their styles:

RenderNode for <div class="visible"> with computed styles:
  Color: blue
  Font-size: 20px

In this example, the <div class="hidden"> is omitted from the Render Tree 
due to its display: none style, 
demonstrating how the Render Tree includes only elements that affect the visual output. -->
